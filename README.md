# üí´About Me 
"Genome Analyst | Data Science Enthusiast | Health Research Advocate<b>

At the intersection of biology and data lies my passion. Currently immersed in the intricate world of bacteria genomes, I'm on a mission to decode the secrets hidden within the genetic fabric of microorganisms. My journey has led me through dynamic pipelines like Bactopia, Viralrecon, and the POPPUNK technique, where I harness the power of nucleotide kmers for population partitioning.<b>

A software developer turned data scientist, I've embraced the synergy of code and data to unearth insights. Python is my trusted companion as I navigate the complexities of data analysis. My foray into the realm of bioinformatics has been nothing short of an exhilarating adventure, and I proudly wear the badge of an amateur bio-informatic.<b>

My roots in the health sector have fueled my exploration. From research data to cutting-edge insights, I thrive on contributing to advancements that impact lives. With every line of code and every dataset explored, my passion for data science and bio-informatics grows stronger.<b>

Join me as I traverse this exciting landscape, unraveling genetic mysteries, and leveraging data for meaningful impact. Let's connect, collaborate, and uncover the future together.<b>

Additional Activities
In addition to my scientific pursuits, I am the founder of the Lwiiyo Community ICT Literacy Initiative, where we empower individuals through technology education. I also coordinate activities at Byte Buddies Computer Club, focusing on teaching kids the wonders of coding, digital literacy, and online safety.
